  abstract = {PurposeRecent advances have uncovered therapeutic interventions that might reduce the risk of progression of premalignant diagnoses, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM). It remains unclear how to best screen populations at risk and how to evaluate the ability of these interventions to reduce disease prevalence and mortality at the population level. To address these questions, we developed a computational modeling framework.Materials and MethodsWe used individual-based computational modeling of MGUS incidence and progression across a population of diverse individuals to determine best screening strategies in terms of screening start, intervals, and risk-group specificity. Inputs were life tables, MGUS incidence, and baseline MM survival. We measured MM-specific mortality and MM prevalence after MGUS detection from simulations and mathematic modeling predictions.ResultsOur framework is applicable to a wide spectrum of screening and intervention scenarios, including variation of the baseline MGUS to MM progression rate and evolving MGUS, in which progression increases over time. Given the currently available point estimate of progression risk reduction to 61\% risk, starting screening at age 55 years and performing follow-up screening every 6 years reduced total MM prevalence by 19\%. The same reduction could be achieved with starting screening at age 65 years and performing follow-up screening every 2 years. A 40\% progression risk reduction per patient with MGUS per year would reduce MM-specific mortality by 40\%. Specifically, screening onset age and screening frequency can change disease prevalence, and progression risk reduction changes both prevalence and disease-specific mortality. Screening would generally be favorable in high-risk individuals.ConclusionScreening efforts should focus on specifically identified groups with high lifetime risk of MGUS, for which screening benefits can be significant. Screening low-risk individuals with MGUS would require improved preventions.},

  abstract = {The celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Society of Clinical Oncology provides the occasion to review the progress that has been made in the biology and treatment of multiple myeloma. With the advent of melphalan and cyclophosphamide in the early 1960s the median survival of patients with multiple myeloma more than doubled from 10 months to approximately 24 months. Throughout multiple clinical trials in the 1970s and 1980s, melphalan and prednisone remained the gold standard, with a 3-year survival of 42\%. The use of high-dose melphalan with autologous hematopoietic stem cell support provided an incremental advance in the 1990s. The outlook for patients was dramatically improved in the 2000s with the introduction of thalidomide analogs and proteasome inhibitors, so that the 3-year survival of patients treated in 2008 with melphalan and prednisone had increased to 66\%. The 2010s are dominated by studying the optimal combination, sequence, and duration of therapies. These clinical advances have occurred along with our evolving understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of myeloma. Myeloma can be divided into two main groups: hyperdiploid, with multiple trisomies of odd-numbered chromosomes, and nonhyperdiploid, with recurrent immunoglobulin heavy chain gene translocations. Disease progression is associated with rearrangements of MYC, the most common mutation in myeloma, present in nearly half of patients. Genomic studies have highlighted marked subclonal heterogeneity that poses one of the main challenges to successful control of the disease. This problem will be addressed in future studies in the 2020s, which will include a focus on immunologic approaches such as monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, engineered T-cells, and novel immunomodulators.},

  abstract = {Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is an emerging discipline that aims to discover how drugs modulate the dynamics of biological components in molecular and cellular networks and the impact of those perturbations on human pathophysiology. The integration of systems-based experimental and computational approaches is required to facilitate the advancement of this field. QSP models typically consist of a series of ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, this mathematical framework requires extensive knowledge of parameters pertaining to biological processes, which is often unavailable. An alternative framework that does not require knowledge of system-specific parameters, such as Boolean network modeling, could serve as an initial foundation prior to the development of an ODE-based model. Boolean network models have been shown to efficiently describe, in a qualitative manner, the complex behavior of signal transduction and gene/protein regulatory processes. In addition to providing a starting point prior to quantitative modeling, Boolean network models can also be utilized to discover novel therapeutic targets and combinatorial treatment strategies. Identifying drug targets using a network-based approach could supplement current drug discovery methodologies and help to fill the innovation gap across the pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we discuss the process of developing Boolean network models and the various analyses that can be performed to identify novel drug targets and combinatorial approaches. An example for each of these analyses is provided using a previously developed Boolean network of signaling pathways in multiple myeloma. Selected examples of Boolean network models of human (patho-)physiological systems are also reviewed in brief.},

Here we used NGS to characterize the genomic landscape of 418 multiple myeloma cases at diagnosis and correlate this with prognosis and classification. Translocations and copy number abnormalities (CNAs) had a preponderant contribution over gene mutations in defining the genotype and prognosis of each case. Known and novel independent prognostic markers were identified in our cohort of proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug-treated patients with long follow-up, including events with context-specific prognostic value, such as deletions of the PRDM1 gene. Taking advantage of the comprehensive genomic annotation of each case, we used innovative statistical approaches to identify potential novel myeloma subgroups. We observed clusters of patients stratified based on the overall number of mutations and number/type of CNAs, with distinct effects on survival, suggesting that extended genotype of multiple myeloma at diagnosis may lead to improved disease classification and prognostication.},

  abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically complex hematological cancer that is characterized by proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. MM evolves from the clonal premalignant disorder monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) by sequential genetic changes involving many different genes, resulting in dysregulated growth of multiple clones of plasma cells. The migration, survival, and proliferation of these clones require the direct and indirect interactions with the non-hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous model of MM development from the MGUS stage. The discrete aspect of the modelisobservedatthecellularlevel: cellsarerepresentedasindividualobjectswhichmove,interact, divide, and die by apoptosis. Each of these actions is regulated by intracellular and extracellular processes as described by continuous models. The hybrid model consists of the following submodels that have been simplified from the much more complex state of evolving MM: cell motion due to chemotaxis, intracellular regulation of plasma cells, extracellular regulation in the bone marrow, and acquisition of mutations upon cell division. By extending a previous, simpler model in which the extracellular matrix was considered to be uniformly distributed, the new hybrid model provides a more accurate description in which cytokines are produced by the marrow microenvironment and consumed by the myeloma cells. The complex multiple genetic changes in MM cells and the numerous cell-cell and cytokine-mediated interactions between myeloma cells and their marrow microenviroment are simplified in the model such that four related but evolving MM clones can be studied as they compete for dominance in the setting of intraclonal heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The role of imaging in myeloma has gained increasing importance over the past few years. The recently revised definition of myeloma from the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) includes cross sectional imaging as a method to define bone disease and also incorporates its use in the disease definition for patients with suspected smouldering myeloma. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence myeloma guidelines also recommend cross sectional imaging for patients with suspected myeloma. There is also increasing use of imaging in disease assessments and the International Myeloma Working Group has recently incorporated imaging in defining new response categories of minimal residual disease negativity, with or without imaging-based evidence of disease. Plain X-rays have previously been the standard imaging modality included in a myeloma work up at presentation but evidence is mounting for use of cross-sectional modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. Funding and therefore availability of newer imaging techniques remains a barrier. Here, we propose an evidence-based approach to the use and technical application of the latest imaging modalities at diagnosis and in the follow-up of patients with myeloma and plasmacytoma.},

In this systematic review we summarize the currently identified clinical, imaging, and genomic biomarkers suggested to increase the progression risk or shown to be differentially expressed/present between both cohorts of patients. Despite the wide range of proposed markers, there are still no reliable biomarkers to individually predict which MGUS patient will progress to MM and which will not. Research on biomarkers in the progression from MGUS to MM will give more insight in the unknown pathogenesis of this hematological malignancy.

We analyzed data from AMG patients (n = 331) enrolled in a prospective, observational clinical trial (S0120). Baseline data from clinical variables, gene expression profiles (GEP) of purified tumor cells, and findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were correlated with the risk of progression to CMM requiring therapy. GEP of purified tumor cells revealed that all molecular subtypes of CMM are also represented in the AMG phase. An increased risk score ({$>$}-0.26) (based on a 70-gene signature, GEP70) was an independent predictor of the risk of progression to CMM. Combination of elevated serum free light chain, M-spike, and GEP70 risk score identified a subset with high risk (67\% at 2 years) of progression to CMM requiring therapy. Importantly, absence of these factors in AMM patients predicted low risk similar to MGUS. Detection of multiple ({$>$}1) focal lesions by MRI also conferred an increased risk of progression. These data demonstrate that signatures associated with high-risk CMM impact disease risk and support inclusion of genomic analysis in the clinical management of AMGs.

  abstract = {Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable heterogeneous hematological malignancy in which immune suppression and complex biology affect the disease and its response to treatment. Bortezomib (btz) and lenalidomide (len) alone or in combination with dexamethasone (dex) or other agents, are the predominant treatments for newly diagnosed and relapsed MM. Unfortunately, no precise method exists to predict disease response, making MM patient management difficult. Predicting treatment response would improve treatment effectiveness, and potentially reduce unnecessary treatment-related adverse events and health care costs.Aim: To determine the application of a genomics-informed predictive simulation model in MM patients treated with btz or len in combination with dex.Methods: Fourteen patients were selected from two datasets. Nine relapsed MM patients were identified from Washington University and 5 newly diagnosed MM patients were identified from the publicly accessible MMRF CoMMpass dataset. In all cases, whole exome sequencing and array CGH were performed. For each patient, every available genomic abnormality was entered into a computational biology program (Cellworks Group) that uses PubMed and other online resources to generate patient-specific protein network maps of activated and inactivated protein pathways (Doudican, et al, J Transl Med, 2015). Digital drug simulations with HMAs were conducted by quantitatively measuring drug effect on a composite MDS disease inhibition score (i.e., cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis). Clinically, patients received standard of care treatment and clinical responses were recorded. Predictive values were calculated based on comparisons of the computer predictions and actual clinical outcomes.Results: The models predicted that 9 patients would respond to combination treatment and 5 would not. All response predictions were properly matched to their clinical response, resulting in 100\% PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Interestingly, the model predicted that 6 of the 9 responders would not have responded to btz or len alone; instead, response was predicted to combination therapy with dex.Conclusions: Computational biology for MM demonstrated high predictive value for response to btz and len with dex. The model may be useful in uncovering the mechanisms for treatment failure and highlight additional pathways that could be targeted to increase chemosensitivity.Vij:Jazz: Consultancy; Shire: Consultancy; Amgen: Consultancy, Research Funding; Takeda: Consultancy, Research Funding; Celgene: Consultancy; Bristol-Myers Squibb: Consultancy; Janssen: Consultancy; Novartis: Consultancy; Karyopharma: Consultancy.

The current approach to address resistance typically involves initiating a new treatment after clinical/radiographic disease progression, ultimately resulting in futility in most patients. Towards a potential alternative solution, we developed a novel computational framework that uses human cancer profiling data to systematically identify dynamic, pre-emptive, and sometimes non-intuitive treatment strategies that can better control tumors in real-time. By studying lung adenocarcinoma clinical specimens and preclinical models, our computational analyses revealed that the best anti-cancer strategies addressed existing resistant subpopulations as they emerged dynamically during treatment. In some cases, the best computed treatment strategy used unconventional therapy switching while the bulk tumor was responding, a prediction we confirmed in vitro. The new framework presented here could guide the principled implementation of dynamic molecular monitoring and treatment strategies to improve cancer control.},

  abstract = {PurposeTo evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging patterns in the bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and to determine a threshold ADC that may help distinguish a diffuse from a normal pattern with high accuracy.Materials and MethodsThis prospective study was approved by the ethics review board, and informed consent was obtained. Ninety-nine patients with newly diagnosed, untreated MM and 16 healthy control subjects underwent spinal MR imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging, and bone marrow ADCs were calculated. Pattern assignment was based on visual assessment of conventional MR images. The Kruskal-Wallis H test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the one-way analysis of variance were used to compare ADCs between patient subsets and control subjects, and a receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed.ResultsMean ADCs ± standard deviation in patients with MM for the normal, focal, and diffuse MR imaging patterns were 0.360 × 10−3 mm2/sec ± 0.110, 1.046 × 10−3 mm2/sec ± 0.232, and 0.770 × 10−3 mm2/sec ± 0.135, respectively. There were significant differences in ADCs between diffuse and normal (P {$<$} .001), diffuse and focal (P {$<$} .001), and focal and normal (P {$<$} .001) patterns. Patients with a diffuse pattern had more features of advanced disease, higher international staging system score, increased incidence of high-risk cytogenetics, and higher revised international staging system score. ADCs greater than 0.548 × 10−3 mm2/sec showed 100\% sensitivity (26 of 26) and 98\% specificity (48 of 49) for the diagnosis of a diffuse (vs normal) MR imaging pattern, whereas an ADC greater than 0.597 × 10−3 mm2/sec showed 96\% sensitivity (25 of 26) and 100\% specificity (49 of 49).ConclusionADCs of MR imaging patterns in patients with MM differ significantly. A diffuse MR imaging pattern can be distinguished more objectively from a normal MR imaging pattern by adding quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging to standard MR imaging protocols.© RSNA, 2016Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant hematologic disorder characterized by bone marrow infiltration with neoplastic plasma cells. Approximately 10\% of all hematologic cancers are related to MM. Whole-body 18F-FDG PETCT is an extremely useful imaging tool for the assessment of patients with MM. The novel approach developed in this research automatically segments bone marrow regions of interest on both the PET and CT datasets. Purpose To automate bone marrow segmentation in PET. Materials and methods Firstly, affine linear transforms are applied to the PET dataset and it is aligned to the CT images. Next, a binary mask is created based on a pixel threshold value of cortical bone. A series of image processing steps are performed to remove noise and fill gaps that correspond to bone marrow locations. This process results in a binary mask relating to bone marrow only which can then be applied to the registered PET dataset. Conclusion The proposed method offers a fully automated and completely objective approach for segmentation of anatomical regions relating to bone marrow. With further development, this method could be used to evaluate clinical images in order to develop a database of PETCT images against which quantitative statistical comparisons between patients with normal bone marrow metabolism and those with myeloma can be made, establishing a baseline against which future scans may be referenced. In cases where the suspicion of myeloma exists, the tools could be used to support the diagnosis of the disease, and may be useful in staging of the disease in cases positive for myeloma.},

  abstract = {Diffuse and focal bone marrow infiltration patterns detected by magnetic resonance imaging have been shown to be of prognostic significance in all stages of monoclonal plasma cell disorders and have, therefore, been incorporated into the definition of the disease. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to develop a rapidly evaluable prognostic scoring system, incorporating the most significant information acquired from magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, the impact of bone marrow infiltration patterns on progression-free and overall survival in 161 transplant-eligible myeloma patients was evaluated. Compared to salt and pepper/minimal diffuse infiltration, moderate/severe diffuse infiltration had a negative prognostic impact on both progression-free survival (P{$<$}0.001) and overall survival (P=0.003). More than 25 focal lesions on whole-body magnetic resonance imaging or more than seven on axial magnetic resonance imaging were associated with an adverse prognosis (progression-free survival: P=0.001/0.003 and overall survival: P=0.04/0.02). A magnetic resonance imaging-based prognostic scoring system, combining grouped diffuse and focal infiltration patterns, was formulated and is applicable to whole-body as well as axial magnetic resonance imaging. The score identified high-risk patients with median progression-free and overall survival of 23.4 and 55.9 months, respectively (whole-body-based). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the magnetic resonance imaging-based prognostic score stage III (high-risk) and adverse cytogenetics are independent prognostic factors for both progression-free and overall survival (whole-body-based, progression-free survival: hazard ratio=3.65, P{$<$}0.001; overall survival: hazard ratio=5.19, P=0.005). In conclusion, we suggest a magnetic resonance imaging-based prognostic scoring system which is a robust, easy to assess and interpret parameter summarizing significant magnetic resonance imaging findings in transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of longitudinal wb-MRIs on progression into multiple myeloma (MM). Sixty-three patients with SMM were analyzed who received at least two wb-MRIs for follow-up before progression into MM. Radiological progressive disease (MRI-PD) was defined as detection of new FL or increase in diameter of existing FL and a novel or progressive diffuse infiltration. Radiological stable disease (MRI-SD) was defined by no change compared with the prior MRI. Patients were followed-up every 3–6 months, including a serological and clinical evaluation. One Hundred and eighty-two wb-MRIs were analyzed. MRI-PD occurred in 31 patients (49\%), and 25 (40\%) patients developed MM. MRI-PD was highly significantly associated with progression into MM, regardless of findings at the initial MRI. In multivariate analysis, MRI-PD remained a risk factor, independent of relevant baseline parameters like serum monoclonal protein or 95\% aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Patients with MRI-SD had no higher risk of progression, even when FL were present at the initial MRI. Therefore, MRI is suitable for the follow-up of patients with SMM.},

  abstract = {Recent population-based studies demonstrate an increased fracture risk with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The etiology of this increased risk remains unclear, however, because areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry cannot assess bone microstructural properties critical to determining bone quality and strength. To better define the skeletal effects of MGUS, we performed aBMD and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measurements in 50 MGUS patients (20 females, 30 males; mean ± SEM age, 70.5 ± 1.4 years) and 100 matched control subjects. Relative to controls, MGUS patients had decreased aBMD at the femoral neck (P = .05) and total femur (P {$<$} .05) but no differences at other sites. In contrast, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography showed markedly diminished cortical thickness (P {$<$} .05) and increased endocortical area (P {$<$} .01). Average vBMD (P {$<$} .01), cortical vBMD (P {$<$} .001), and trabecular thickness (P {$<$} .01) were all significantly decreased in MGUS patients, suggestive of impaired bone formation. Serum levels of the Wnt pathway inhibitor Dickkopf-related protein 1 (P {$<$} .001) and osteoclast-activating factor MIP-1α (P {$<$} .05) also were significantly elevated in MGUS patients. Our data provide the first evidence of altered bone microstructure in MGUS and suggest that cytokines elevated in osteolytic myeloma also may be associated with bone loss in MGUS.},

Disease progression of MM was independently associated with high CTv on multivariate analysis. In symptomatic MM, the presence of abnormal medullary lesions was associated with increased incidence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (34.4\% vs 7.7\%; P=0.002) and extramedullary disease (10.4\% vs 0\%; P=0.032). It was also an independent poor prognostic predictor (hazard ratio 3.546, P=0.04). This study showed that CTv of AS by MDCT is correlated with disease progression of MM, and the presence of abnormal medullary lesions is a predictor for poor survival.},

  abstract = {Summary This International Myeloma Working Group consensus updates the disease definition of multiple myeloma to include validated biomarkers in addition to existing requirements of attributable CRAB features (hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, and bone lesions). These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.},

  abstract = {Plasma cells are developed from B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells that is generated in the bone marrow. The plasma cells produce antibodies to fight with bacteria and viruses and stop infection and disease. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that collections of abnormal plasma cells (myeloma cells) accumulate in the bone marrow. The definitive diagnosis of multiple myeloma is done by searching for myeloma cells in the bone marrow slides through a microscope. Diagnosis of myeloma cells from bone marrow smears is a subjective and time-consuming task for pathologists. Also, because of depending on final decision on human eye and opinion, error risk in decision may occur. Sometimes, existence of infection in body causes plasma cell's increment which could be diagnosed wrongly as multiple myeloma. The computer diagnostic process will reduce the diagnostic time and also can be worked as a second opinion for pathologists. This study presents a computer-aided diagnostic method for myeloma cells diagnosis from bone marrow smears. At first, white blood cells consist of plasma cells and other marrow cells are separated from the red blood cells and background. Then, plasma cells are detected from other marrow cells by feature extraction and series of decision rules. Finally, normal plasma cells and myeloma cells could be classified easily by a classifier. This algorithm is applied on 50 digital images that are provided from bone marrow aspiration smears. These images contain 678 cells: 132 normal plasma cells, 256 myeloma cells and 290 other types of marrow cells. Applying the computer-aided diagnostic method for identifying myeloma cells on provided database showed a sensitivity of 96.52\%; specificity of 93.04\% and precision of 95.28\%.},

  abstract = {Hematological malignancies manifest as lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma, and remain a burden on society. From initial therapy to endless relapse-related treatment, societal burden is felt not only in the context of healthcare cost, but also in the compromised quality of life of patients. Long-term therapeutic strategies have become the standard in keeping hematological malignancies at bay as these cancers develop resistance to each round of therapy with time. As a result, there is a continual need for the development of new drugs to combat resistant disease in order to prolong patient life, if not to produce a cure. This review aims to summarize advances in targeting lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma through both cutting-edge and well established platforms. Current standard of treatment will be reviewed for these malignancies and emphasis will be made on new therapy development in the areas of antibody engineering, epigenetic small molecule inhibiting drugs, vaccine development, and chimeric antigen receptor cell engineering. In addition, platforms for the delivery of these and other drugs will be reviewed including antibody-drug conjugates, micro- and nanoparticles, and multimodal hydrogels. Lastly, we propose that tissue engineered constructs for hematological malignancies are the missing link in targeted drug discovery alongside mouse and patient-derived xenograft models.},

  abstract = {Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is one of the most common premalignant disorders. IgG and IgA MGUS are precursor conditions of multiple myeloma (MM), whereas light-chain MGUS is a precursor condition of light-chain MM. Smoldering MM (SMM) is a precursor condition with higher tumor burden and higher risk of progression to symptomatic MM compared to MGUS. Assessment of the risk of progression of patients with asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathies is based on various factors including clonal burden, as well as biological characteristics, such as cytogenetic abnormalities and light-chain production. Several models have been constructed that are useful in daily practice for predicting risk of progression of MGUS or SMM. Importantly, the plasma cell clone may occasionally be responsible for severe organ damage through the production of a M-protein which deposits in tissues or has autoantibody activity. These disorders are rare and often require therapy directed at eradication of the underlying clone. Importantly, recent studies have shown that asymptomatic patients with a bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥60\%, free light-chain ratio ≥100, or {$>$}1 focal lesion on MRI (myeloma-defining events) have a 80\% risk of developing symptomatic MM within 2~years. These patients are now considered to have MM requiring therapy, similar to patients with symptomatic disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the new diagnostic criteria of the monoclonal gammopathies and discuss risk of progression to active MM. We also provide recommendations for the management of patients with MGUS and SMM including risk-adapted follow-up.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of tumor burden, secreted proteins or other biomarkers over time, is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and to predict outcomes for patients. Many methods have been proposed to investigate longitudinal trends to better characterize patients and to understand disease progression. However, most approaches assume a homogeneous patient population and a uniform response trajectory over time and across patients. Here, we present a mixture piecewise linear Bayesian hierarchical model, which takes into account both population heterogeneity and nonlinear relationships between biomarkers and time. Simulation results show that our method was able to classify subjects according to their patterns of treatment response with greater than 80\% accuracy in the three scenarios tested. We then applied our model to a large randomized controlled phase III clinical trial of multiple myeloma patients. Analysis results suggest that the longitudinal tumor burden trajectories in multiple myeloma patients are heterogeneous and nonlinear, even among patients assigned to the same treatment cohort. In addition, between cohorts, there are distinct differences in terms of the regression parameters and the distributions among categories in the mixture. Those results imply that longitudinal data from clinical trials may harbor unobserved subgroups and nonlinear relationships; accounting for both may be important for analyzing longitudinal data.},
