#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic clonal plasma cell disorder
defined by the presence of a serumplasma cell disorder defined by the p
monoclonal component (MC) of ⩾ 3 g/dl and/or of 410% clonal bone marrow plasma
cells (BMPC), with no evidence of endbone marrow plasma cells (BMPC), with no
evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB features, including hypercalcemia, renal
failure, anemia or lytic bone lesions, and/or additional myeloma-defining events
(MDE), including biomarkers of malignancy).1 The progression rate into active
multiple myeloma (MM) is 10% per year for the first 5 years, the cumulative
probability of progression is 73% at 15 years.1
Therefore, identification of predictors of progression into MM is of great
importance.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Several markers (serum MC, percentage of BMPC, serum free light chain (sFLC),
ratio, immunophenotyping of aberrant plasma cells, tumor genetic abnormalities
and focal lesions (FLs) at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) have already been
established to identify sub-groups of SMM patients with the highest risk of
progression into MM.2

Among imaging methods, positron emission tomography (PET) integrated with
computed tomography (PET/CT) using glucose labelled with the positron-emitting
radionuclide 18F (fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)) is a reliable technique for
asses sing early skeletal involvement and for predicting outcomes at the onset
of MM.3–7

a total of 120 patients (76 males and 44 females) with
SMM entered this prospective observational study
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

PET/CT scans were excluded from the study if: (a) they were poor-quality images
with low statistics that were not considered suitable for diagnostic interpreta
tion, (b) the image data set was incomplete, and (c) large discrepancies
concerning uptake time and administered dose were found analyzing DICOM headers
of PET scans.

PET/CT was considered positive for SMM patients in the presence of one of the
following:

1. focal areas of visually detectable increased tracer uptake within bones
   (for example, more intense than background BM uptake) excluding articular
   processes, without any underlying lesion identified by CT and present on at
   least two consecutive slices (to avoid a misinterpretation as BM mild
   non-homogeneous FDG uptake). The number, size and location of hypermetabolic
   focal lesions (PET-FLs) were recorded. The degree of FDG uptake was
   represented by standardized uptake value (SUV) maximum (max) in the hottest
   lesion;
2. diffusely increased tracer uptake with a SUVmax equal to, or greater
   than, the uptake in the liver. In this case, SUVmax was measured in the
   hottest area within the BM.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
All patients were studied at baseline with 18F-FDG PET/CT, performed
locally in each hematological institution; images were thereafter uploaded
in a system for central review. Axial magnetic resonance (MRI) (spine and
pelvis) or whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) were likewise executed at study entry
in 91/120 patients and were interpreted locally in each institution.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PET/CT was completely negative in 101/120 (84%) of the patients at diagnosis and
positive in 19/120 (16%) of them.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In 91/120 patients, a baseline axial (79) or WB-MRI (12) was performed and was
completely negative in 73% of them and positive in 27%,
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Agreement between PET/CT and MRI scans in the 91 patients for whom both the
imaging techniques were available was 77% (kappa = 0.32, which means only fair
agreement); more particularly both PET/CT and MRI were negative in 67% of the
patients and positive in 10% of them.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
With a median follow-up of 2.2 years from the time of study entrance to December
2014 (IQR 1–5 years), 74 (62%) of the patients remained in the smoldering phase,
while 46 (38%) progressed to active MM, in a median time of 4 years. Progression
to active MM was documented by skeletal MDE, with/without the presence of other
CRAB features, in 21% of the patients and by any one or more of the CRAB
features, without skeletal MDE, in 17% of cases.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The univariate analysis revealed that the presence of a positive PET/CT (that
is, at least 1 FL and/or diffuse involvement), the size of MC (as a continuous
variable), BMPC460% and a diffuse BMinfiltration at MRI were adverse prognostic
factors for progression to active disease
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The median TTP and TTP with skeletal MDE for patients with positive PET/CT were
1.1 and 2.2 years, respectively, in comparison with corresponding values of 4.5
and 6.9 years for PET/CT-negative patients.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In a Cox regression analysis of baseline prognostic factors, the
presence of PET/CT positivity along with BMPC460% wereindependent predictors of shorter TTP to active MM.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In light of the advances in laboratory and imaging techniques, providing higher
sensitivity and ability to detect early damage, and of the data showing improved
outcomes with early intervention in high-risk SMM,25 diagnostic criteria were
recently updated by the IMWG.8 In particular, two major changes were
established, the first one, based on robust studies, defining those patients
carrying at least one out of three biomarkers of progression (that is, clonal
BMPC460%, sFLC ratioprog ⩾ 100 and 41 FL at MRI), with approximately 80% risk of
developing end-organ damage within 2 years from ddeveloping end-organ damage
within 2 years from diagnosis, such as active MM, requiring immediate treatment.
The second major improvement was the definition of bone lesions, within MDE, not
only on the appearance of sites of bone destruction on skeletal radiography but
also on the presence of osteolytic lesions on CT or PET/CT, thanks to the
well-recognized higher sensitivity of newer imaging techniques over WBXR, more
lesions being detected and at an earlier phase.7

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
18F-FDG PET/CT is a nuclear imaging procedure that combines functional imaging
(the PET part) and morphological assessment by CT, allowing high-sensitivity and
specificity detection of hypermetabolic lesions, intramedullary and
extramedullary, BM involvement and osteolytic lesions as well as exact
anatomical localization thereof. Bone lesions are identified with a resolution
limit of 0.5 cm.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This study demonstrates, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the
prognostic significance of FLs in the absence of underlying osteolytic lesions,
as detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT, in patients with SMM for progression into active
disease.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Early detection of occult lesions may provide important benefits for patients by
preventing skeletal complications and pain, as well as promoting quality of
life.27 In addition to the identification of early skeletal destruction, in this
prospective study of 120 SMM patients we found that PET/CT can show the presence
of sites of focal hypermetabolic lesions (FLs) or diffuse BM hypermetabolism, in
the absence of osteolytic lesions, in approximately 16% of cases. Moreover, we
first provide demonstration that this imaging technique is a reliable predictor
of prognosis not only in active MM3,4 but also in SMM.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In particular, the probability of progression within 2 and 3 years for patients
with positive PET/ CT was 58% and 66%, respectively, as compared with 33% and
42% for negative patients. The risk of progression into active MM increased with
the increasing number of FLs and with the increasing SUVmax value. However, the
low number of patients, when grouped for FLs, diffuse pattern or SUVmax value,
prevented us from finding an optimal cutoff to discriminate higher risk of
progression into active disease in the 80% range at 2 years.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One concern with the serial use of PET/CT in clinical trials could be the
heterogeneity of the visual criteria and the lack of inter observer
reproducibility in interpreting results. Several attempts to standardize
criteria for PET/CT imaging definitions and use of semi-quantitative SUV
evaluations are now on-going to consoli date the use of this technique as a
prognostic tool.32

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Agreement between PET/CT and MRI in the 91 patients for whom both imaging
techniques were available was only fair; in particular, as already previously
demonstrated in symptomatic MM,30 MRI seemed to be more sensitive in the axial
skeleton, detecting abnormalities in 18% more patients, while PET/CT was more
sensitive in 5% of cases, out of the MRI field of view.
